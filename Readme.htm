<h1>Gyro: Get Your Raid On!</h1>

<p>
	Gyro lets you set up macros (lists of commands) to be run whenever you join 
	or leave a raid, for convenience or laziness.&nbsp; You can, for example, 
	enable raid UI mods only when you&#39;re actually in a raid, disabling them when 
	you&#39;re done.</p>
<h2>
	Installing Gyro</h2>
<p>
	Gyro is installed like pretty much every other World of Warcraft mod on the 
	planet.&nbsp; Extract the contents of the zip file to your Add-ons folder, 
	generally located here:</p>
<p class="codeblock">
	<code>C:\Program Files\World of Warcraft\Interface\Addons</code></p>
<h2>Getting started</h2>
<p><i>If you&#39;re quite familiar with macros already, you might want to skip this 
section and go straight to &quot;Gyro setup guide for l33t macro masters.&quot;</i></p>
<p>When you first log in after installing and enabling Gyro, you won&#39;t notice 
anything different.&nbsp; Gyro doesn&#39;t know what you want yet, so it won&#39;t do 
anything.&nbsp; Gyro is controlled through slash commands, which work very much 
like the emotes, such as /dance.&nbsp; To see what options Gyro has, type the 
following command in your chat window:</p>
<p class="codeblock">
	<code>/gyro</code></p>
<p>This will list all of the different commands you can use with Gyro.&nbsp; The 
first thing you want to do is set up the Gyro macros, so type this command:</p>
<p class="codeblock">
	<code>/gyro macros</code></p>
<p>This will open up the Macros UI.&nbsp; If you haven&#39;t see this window before, 
macros are batches of commands that can be run all at once.&nbsp; Normally you 
do this so that you can assign things you commonly say and do to a single button 
on your action bar, but Gyro also uses macros to control its behavior.&nbsp; The 
Macros window has two tabs at the top: the one on the left contains macros 
shared by all of your characters, and the one on the right contains macros that 
are specific to the character you&#39;re currently playing.&nbsp; Click that tab.</p>
<p>You should see two macros here: one with a red minus sign called GyroEndRaid, 
and one with a blue plus sign called GyroStartRaid.&nbsp; All of the commands in 
GyroStartRaid will be run each time that you enter a raid, and all of the 
commands in GyroEndRaid will be run when you leave a raid, and when you first 
log in.&nbsp; Right now, all that&#39;s in each macro is a helpful instruction.</p>
<p>Now you need to decide what you want each macro to do.&nbsp; Click on 
GyroStartRaid (the blue plus sign).&nbsp; Replace the macro that Gyro created 
for you with the following text:</p>
<p class="codeblock">
	<code>/s Hey everyone, I just entered a raid!</code></p>
<p>Note that this looks exactly like something that you&#39;d normally type into the 
chat window.&nbsp; If this is what your GyroStartRaid macro contains and you&#39;re 
invited to a raid group, you&#39;ll say &quot;Hey everyone, I just entered a raid!&quot; to 
everyone around you.&nbsp; Annoying and not very useful, but it&#39;s a start.</p>
<p>Now, to test this out, you can ask a friend to invite you to a raid.&nbsp; If 
you don&#39;t have any friends, there&#39;s another way to test your new macro out.&nbsp; 
Type the following command into the chat window (close the Macros window if you 
still have it open):</p>
<p class="codeblock">
	<code>/gyro on</code></p>
<p>This command makes Gyro act as if you&#39;re in a raid, even if you&#39;re not.&nbsp; 
When you type that command, notice that you just told everyone around you that 
you entered a raid.&nbsp; How embarrassing.&nbsp; Gyro isn&#39;t very useful if you 
force it on all the time, so let&#39;s put it back into the normal &quot;automatic&quot; mode 
by typing this command:</p>
<p class="codeblock">
	<code>/gyro auto</code></p>
<p>So, neat, perhaps, but still not very useful.&nbsp; Now it&#39;s time to decide 
what you really want to happen when you join or leave a raid.&nbsp; Personally, 
I use Gyro to disable and hide some of my mods when I&#39;m not in a raid and I 
don&#39;t need them.&nbsp; For example, I can use Gyro to turn off Hear Kitty when 
I&#39;m not in a raid, and turn it back on when I join one.</p>
<p class="codeblock">
	<b>GyroStartRaid:</b><br />
	<code>/hearkitty on</code></p>
<p class="codeblock">
	<b>GyroEndRaid:</b><br />
	<code>/hearkitty off</code></p>
<p>You probably had something else in mind when you downloaded this mod.&nbsp; 
Go ahead and set up your two macros to do whatever you like now.&nbsp; It&#39;s okay 
to leave one of them blank, if, for example, you only want to do something when 
joining a raid, but not when leaving a raid.</p>
<p><b>Important: Gyro macros can&#39;t be used to cast spells or use items.</b>&nbsp; 
This is a restriction that Blizzard puts on mods to prevent botting and 
automated play.&nbsp; If you put a restricted action in one of your Gyro macros, 
Gyro will skip that action and warn you about this in the chat window.</p>

<p>Once you&#39;ve gotten more familiar with Gyro, you&#39;ll want to check out the 
section titled &quot;More Gyro options.&quot;</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

<h2>Gyro setup guide for l33t macro masters</h2>
<p>Already know a lot about macros, and you already skipped the previous section?&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; 
I&#39;ll keep this short.&nbsp; Type this command at a 
chat window:</p>
<p class="codeblock">
	<code>/gyro macros</code></p>
<p>This will automatically create two character-specific macros for you, 
<strong>GyroStartRaid</strong> and <strong>GyroEndRaid</strong>.&nbsp; The former will be executed whenever you 
join a raid, and the latter will be executed whenever you leave one.&nbsp; Write 
these like you would any other macros.&nbsp; Easy as that.&nbsp; Type &quot;/gyro&quot; at 
the chat window for more options.</p>

<h2>More Gyro options</h2>
<p>Gyro is pretty simple, but it does have a few options that you can set.</p>
<h3>Forcing Gyro in or out of raid mode</h3>

<p>Normally, Gyro automatically detects whether or not you&#39;re in a raid, and 
runs the appropriate macro for your situation.&nbsp; However, when testing out 
your macros, or in certain other circumstances, you might want to override this.&nbsp; 
Gyro has handy options for doing just that.</p>
<p class="codeblock">
	<code>/gyro auto</code>
	<br /><code>/gyro on</code>
	<br /><code>/gyro off</code>
</p>
<p>The default is <b>auto</b>, which detects whether or not you&#39;re in a raid for 
you.&nbsp; You can use <b>/gyro on</b> to be in raid mode even when you&#39;re not in a 
raid, or <b>/gyro off</b> to be in non-raid mode even when you&#39;re in a raid.</p>
<h3>Do battleground raids count as raids?</h3>

<p>Some people consider PVP battlegrounds as raids, and some people don&#39;t.&nbsp; 
You can decide whether Gyro counts a battleground raid as a raid (&quot;on&quot;) or not 
(&quot;off&quot;) with these commands:</p>
<p class="codeblock">
	<code>/gyro bg on</code>
	<br /><code>/gyro bg off</code>
</p>
<h2>Suggestions</h2>
<h3>Reminding yourself to repair and buy reagents before raids</h3>
<p>You can use Gyro to remind yourself to get reagents and repair before raids.</p>
<p class="codeblock">
	<b>GyroStartRaid:</b><br />
	<code>/w Vger Don't forget to repair and buy reagents!</code></p>
	<p>Replacing "Vger" with your own character's name, of course.</p>
<h2>Using Gyro with your favorite mods</h2>
<p>Here are some tips for using Gyro with other mods.</p>
<h3>Hear Kitty</h3>
<p class="codeblock">
	<b>GyroStartRaid:</b><br />
	<code>/hearkitty on</code></p>
<p class="codeblock">
	<b>GyroEndRaid:</b><br />
	<code>/hearkitty off</code></p>
<h3>KLHThreatMeter (KTM)</h3>
<p class="codeblock">
	<b>GyroStartRaid:</b><br />
	<code>/ktm g s</code></p>
<p class="codeblock">
	<b>GyroEndRaid:</b><br />
	<code>/ktm g h</code></p>
<h3>Omen</h3>
<p>As of writing, Omen has a slash command to toggle the display, but not to 
explicitly turn it on or off.&nbsp; But, there&#39;s a workaround.</p>
<p class="codeblock">
	<b>GyroStartRaid:</b><br />
	<code>/script Omen:Toggle(true)</code></p>
<p class="codeblock">
	<b>GyroEndRaid:</b><br />
	<code>/script Omen:Toggle(false)</code></p>
<h3>Grid</h3>
<p class="codeblock">
	<b>GyroStartRaid:</b><br />
	<code>/script GridLayoutFrame:Show()</code></p>
<p class="codeblock">
	<b>GyroEndRaid:</b><br />
	<code>/script GridLayoutFrame:Hide()</code></p>
<h3>Spirit Versus Intellect UI</h3>
<p class="codeblock">
	<b>GyroStartRaid:</b><br />
	<code>/sviui show</code></p>
<p class="codeblock">
	<b>GyroEndRaid:</b><br />
	<code>/sviui hide</code></p>

	else leaves or joins the battleground after you join.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Future versions</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Support for parties as well as raids would be another good option.&nbsp; 
	And it's been requested to add the capability to do some things only for 
	normal/heroic raids and not LFR raids.&nbsp; (For example, <b>/gyro lfr off</b>.)</li>
	<li>I should make a UI to set the Gyro options in the Interface Options dialog.</li>
	<li>Gyro doesn't actually need the various commands it runs to be in macros; 
	I could move them out to a separate location so that it doesn't take up two 
	macro slots.</li>
</ul>
